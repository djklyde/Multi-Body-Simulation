# Multi-Body-Simulation
A pre-written program to output simulations of multi-body planetary systems using an Euler Numerical integration method.
The program is written so it requires minimal input from the user. 
In a Pandas dataframe, define the masses, initial positions, and initial velocities of your chosen system. 
Run through the rest of the cells in the program until the last one. Define your number of time-steps and total time for the simulation.
If you are defining this by the period function given, be sure to change the period to be defined by the outermost planet in the system.
Change the name of your simulation.
Run the simulation. For each time-step, the program will use an Euler Numerical integration technique to update the position and velocity for each object in the system.
Once the simulation is fully run, it will output an MP4 video depicting the full orbits of the system that was just simulated.
